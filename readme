 - Stream API coding Questions

𝐓𝐨𝐩𝐢𝐜 𝟕: 𝐃𝐞𝐯𝐨𝐩𝐬 𝐐𝐮𝐞𝐬𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐬 𝐨𝐧 𝐃𝐞𝐩𝐥𝐨𝐲𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭 𝐓𝐨𝐨𝐥𝐬 
 - These types of topics are mostly asked by managers or leads who are heavily working on it, That's why they may grill you on DevOps/deployment-related tools, You should have an understanding of common tools like Jenkins, Kubernetes, Kafka, Cloud, and all.

𝐓𝐨𝐩𝐢𝐜 𝟖: 𝐁𝐞𝐬𝐭 𝐏𝐫𝐚𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐜𝐞 
 - The interviewer always wanted to ask about some design patterns, it maybe Normal design patterns like singleton, factory, or observer patterns to know that you can use these in coding.
